# Covid-19 Android Mobile Application

This application is developed using Android Studio. To open and run the application on Android Studio, download the files and open the project in Android Studio and run the project.

An Android emulator has to be installed first before running the application. For the best experience, use Google Pixel as the android emulator as the graphical user interface was design based on the screen size and resolution of Google Pixel.

NOTE: Change the jdk version in your Android Studio to jdk 11 (version 11.0.10).
